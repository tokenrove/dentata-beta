\section{Packing}

8bpp: Only zero and one bit alphas are valid, and unlike other depths,
one bit alpha does not store the alpha values independently of the data.
The value of zero is considered transparent when the alpha is set to
zero in eight bits per pixel. This depth implies the use of a palette.

15bpp: Undecided -- this is reserved for future expansion.

16bpp: Data contains RGB packed into little endian groupings of 16-bits,
$^{15}BBBBBGGG^8 G^7GGRRRRR^0$. Alpha depths of one, two, four, and
eight bits are valid, and are stored independantly of the data. Alpha is
packed from least to greatest, so four bit alpha is split as $2^72221111^0$,
two bit alpha as $4^74332211^0$, and so forth.

24bpp: Packing is one component per byte, BGR. Alpha is seperate, and
is the same as for 16bpp, above.
